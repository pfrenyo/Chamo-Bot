This repository implements the Chamo-Bots, bots written in Python mainly destined to be used on the Chamo discord server.
The code can be run on Chocobot, Lamia-Bot, Moogle-Bot or WhiteMage on my Discord server, to different results.
So far, running it on Chocobot, Lamia-Bot and Moogle-Bot produces the same result, while WhiteMage implements different functions.
