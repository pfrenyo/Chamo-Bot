# HOW TO USE
This folder normally contains 4 files:
admin.key, lamia.key, moogle.key and chocobo.key

- admin.key contains the id of the administrator of the bot. The functions in the 'admin.py' cog will only work with said user id.
- lamia.key, moogle.key and chocobo.key contain token ids of the bot to launch. This is so the admin can choose which one to launch the script with.
